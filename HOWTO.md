\# How To Guide

\- Step One

&nbsp; - Go to your GTA V Game Directory

  *- > This will be different for everyone based on how they installed the base game!*

\- Step Two

&nbsp; - Navigate to \[YourGTAVDirectory]/x64/audio

&nbsp; - Make a backup of your RESIDENT.rpf file.

\- Step Three

&nbsp; - Take the RESIDENT.rpf file out of your proffered pack and drag it into the directory you just opened.

&nbsp; - > This should ask you if you want to override the existing file. Choose YES.

\- Step Four

&nbsp; - You're done! Relaunch your game and enjoy the cutest of siren packs.



> **Important:** Unless you know what you're doing and want to edit or grab specific files to remake a pack based on my sounds, ignore the Vehicles folder and VEHICLES.awc file.
