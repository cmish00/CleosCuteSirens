# How To Guide
- **Step One**
  - Go to your GTA V Game Directory
  - > This will be different for everyone based on how they installed the base game!
- **Step Two**
  - Navigate to [YourGTAVDirectory]/x64/audio
  - Make a backup of your RESIDENT.rpf file.
- **Step Three**
  - Take the RESIDENT.rpf file out of your proffered pack and drag it into the directory you just opened.
  - > This should ask you if you want to override the existing file. Choose YES.
- **Step Four**
  - You're done! Relaunch your game and enjoy the cutest of siren packs.

> **Important**: Unless you know what you're doing and want to edit or grab specific files to remake a pack based on my sounds, ignore the Vehicles folder and VEHICLES.awc file.
